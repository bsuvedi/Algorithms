Longest Common Subsequence Project
The following program finds the longest common substring of two different strings i.e the longest
substrings contained in both first and second strings. There there are no common substring,
then the LCS of the program would be zero.
Now we are going to compute the longest common substring using a Java Program X[1….m]
and y [1….n]. It means that the the string are of different lengths i.e that would be n and m . and
we have to find we have to find if they have any common subsequence.
For example, we have a string x = APBCADCQER and its length is 10 and we have. Now have
another string which is ASBTAUCVE and now we have to find the longest common
subsequence. The lenght of the LCS would be 5 and the longest common subsequence would
be ABACE
